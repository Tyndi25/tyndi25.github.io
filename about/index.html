<p><br></p>

<p>I am a 28 year old geek, father, husband and amatuer hockey official who works as a software engineer during the week. I have been exposed to many different technologies during my short career in the software world. Technologies such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>MSSQL</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>ASP.NET</li>
<li>Visual C++</li>
<li>Javascript (And its many flavors)

<ol>
<li>React</li>
<li>Meteor</li>
<li>GraphQL</li>
</ol></li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>DynamoDB</li>
<li>Amazon Web Services</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few of the technologies I have worked with over the years. I have been working with Javascript/ReactJS and various AWS tools the most over the past two years. But I have been attempting to make time to learn and experiment with other similar and vastly different technologies while at home.</p>
